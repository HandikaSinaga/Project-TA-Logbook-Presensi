# Frontend Environment Configuration
# 
# NOTE: This project uses backend-served configuration at runtime.
# Frontend does NOT require a .env file for sensitive data.
# All runtime config is fetched from GET /api/config endpoint.
#
# If you absolutely need build-time environment variables (not recommended),
# add them here as VITE_* variables. However, the application is designed
# to work without any frontend .env file.
#
# Example (optional, not used by default):
# VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001

# Do NOT add sensitive keys like:
# - GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET (backend only)
# - JWT_SECRET (backend only)
# - Database credentials (backend only)
